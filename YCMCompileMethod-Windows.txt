1. Make a new empty folder called ycm_build
2. Download a windows version of clang [http://www.ishani.org/web/articles/code/clang-win32/]
3. Put the windows version in a folder somewhere
4. Modify the ycm CMakeLists.txt because it fails to find clang, just replace the TEMP in set( EXTERNAL_LICLANG_PATH TEMP ) with the correct path
5. Configure using cmake-gui, USE_CLANG_COMPLETER should be true but nothing else. Visual Studio 11 output was used
6. Open the solution in visual studio and build the ycm_core solution
7. Copy the output ycm_core.lib, ycm_core.pyd and libclang.dll to the YouCompleteMe/python directory

NOTE: You also may need to add boost:: to some of the bind, make_shared and other calls in a few of the source files
